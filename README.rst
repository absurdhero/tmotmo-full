The Making of The Making of - Same Not Same
===========================================

Same Not Same lets you experience and puzzle your way through the
song of the same name. The game exudes classic adventure game nostalgia
while taking advantage of the interactive nature of multi-touch devices.

Setup
-----

This project requires Unity 3.5 and the basic iOS license to build and run
correctly.  It is possible to run the game with the free Unity editor but you
wouldn't be able to give the game any touch input. You could modify the code to
use mouse input instead!

The first time you open the project, Unity will spend some time importing
assets.  Once it is finished, you should go to File -> Build Settings, select
iOS, and press "Switch Platform." This will let you set the resolution in the
Game window to iPhone Wide (480x320).
